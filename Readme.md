# Pokédex

This project is a Pokédex inspired by the design found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/I1UN7M52MlcqEyRX9tps10/Pok%C3%A9dex-(Community)?node-id=1016-1461). It is an Android application developed using Kotlin and follows the principles of Clean Architecture.

## Features

The application includes the following features:

- **Data Binding**: Efficient handling of data objects within the app's UI.
- **Room**: Robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- **Paging**: Loading and displaying small chunks of data at a time.
- **RecyclerView**: Displaying large sets of data in a scrolling list.
- **WorkManager**: Managing Android background jobs.
- **Flow**: Handling asynchronous streams of data.
- **Koin**: Practical and easy-to-use Kotlin dependency injection.
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns between the different layers of the application.
